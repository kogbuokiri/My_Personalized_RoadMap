# My_Personalized_RoadMap

ðŸš€ **Getting on the data structure/algorithm prep train** â€“ one day at a time!  
ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date:** September 2025  
ðŸ“š **Platform:** [Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/)

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
This repository serves as my roadmap for mastering **data structures** and **algorithms**, preparing for technical interviews, and deepening my problem-solving skills.

## ðŸ“† Timeline
- **Phase 1:** Fundamentals (Arrays, Linked Lists, Recursion)
- **Phase 2:** Advanced Structures (Binary Trees, Graphs, Heaps)
- **Phase 3:** Algorithms (Sorting, Dynamic Programming, Graph Traversal)
- **Phase 4:** Mock Interviews & Problem Solving

## ðŸ“‚ Resources
- **Primary:** [Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/)
- **Additional:** Leetcode, HackerRank, Cracking the Coding Interview
